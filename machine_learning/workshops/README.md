# Scikit-Learn Workshops

Together we will develop our knowledge of the popular machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. 

Our aim is to gain machine learning experience through these workshops, so that we can ultimately apply what we have learned on our personally curated [datasets](https://github.com/INASIC/conus-exogenomics/tree/master/machine_learning/datasets) within the conus exogenomics group.
